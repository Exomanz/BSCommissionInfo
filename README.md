# Beat Saber -- Mod Commission Information
You can find all of my commission information, pricing, and terms in this repository.

## Introduction
Hey guys! I'm Exomanz (Exo), and I make PC mods that mostly centralize around adding more customization to your Beat Saber experience. I've been modding since late 2020.

I'm a college student and am currently studying Computer and Network Administration; development may stagnate at times because my schoolwork always comes first. 

## Notable Projects
- [UITweaks](https://github.com/Exomanz/UITweaks) - Spice up your in-game HUD with some color, featuring a highly extensive configuration system.
- [MenuSaberColors](https://github.com/Exomanz/MenuSaberColors) - A PC port of im-henri's QonsistentSaberColors for Quest, which allows your menu pointers to be the same color as your in-game sabers! 
- [BetterStaticLights](https://github.com/Exomanz/BetterStaticLights) - Beat Saber mod that lets you choose which lights you want active when "Static Lights" is on. 

## Terms of Service
- First and foremost, I reserve the right to deny any mod that I deem to be too difficult, complex, or reasonably unachievable for me.
- I have a zero-tolerance policy when it comes to harassment. If you cannot act responsibly, find another person to commission.
- All content will be delivered via Discord DM in the form of screenshots, videos, or files. 
- Finished works will be open-source and published to my GitHub page under the MIT license, which allows for others to contribute their own code and maintain the mod themselves.
  - If you wish for your commission to be closed-source, a valid and reasonable explanation is required.
  - If you wish for your commission to have a license besides MIT, please specify.

## Commission Info
- Please be as precise as possible about what you want. If I have a clear picture of what you're looking for, things will be easier for the both of us.
  - Illustrations, videos, all of the like are welcome. Anything that helps me understand exactly what you want.
  - I'll give you a guesstimated range on how much I would charge for the project based on what I deem the complexity to be.
- You can expect pricing to be anywhere between $20 and $35 per hour that I work on the project, $20 minimum. The exact rate that I determine for a commission is based on the complexity and difficulty of the request.
  - Hours of effort include time spent developing **and** testing the mod, and I will accurately track these hours.
  - I will round up or down to the nearest hour.
- If you wish that I consistently maintain the mod throughout game updates, another $10 flat rate will be charged on top of the original commission total. 
  - Otherwise, I will update the mod on my own time.
- If you set a deadline and I am unable to meet it due to outside circumstances, you will be notified.

## Payment
- Right now, I am only accepting payments on my [PayPal](https://paypal.me/trusch12) or [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/exo_manz).
- As stated before, I will guesstimate how much I charge for a commission based on what I deem the complexity to be.
- 50% of the guesstimated total will be due up-front before development starts. The other 50% will be due once the commission is complete.

## Wrap-Up
Most of what you need to know is outlined in this repository, but if you have any questions regarding commissions from me, shoot me a DM on Discord (Exo#8083). I'm also in the Beat Saber Commissions Center and the Beat Saber Modding Group, so you can find me there if you need me. Thanks for reading!
